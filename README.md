# Eudemonia

*eudemonia (noun)*
1. happiness, well-being.
2. A person’s state of excellence characterized by objective flourishing across a lifetime, and brought about through the exercise of moral virtue, practical wisdom, and rationality.

**Inspiration**

- Simple activities + reminders to take care of yourself
- Low-fi text reminders (rather than flashy push notifications) - keep people off their phones and out doing things in the real world
- Our app doesn’t require a lengthy signup/set up process 
- We want our app to address health as well-rounded and holistic

**What it does**

- Eudemonia texts the user 2-3 times a week and suggests a small wellness activity for them to engage in (ex: a quick meditation, journal prompt, or short TED talk) 
- These wellness activities are sorted into the wellness categories emotional wellness, physical wellness, intellectual wellness, spiritual wellness, social wellness, and occupational wellness. We did this to make sure the user isn’t neglecting any part of their wellbeing
- Our app addresses the users wellbeing from a holistic well-rounded standpoint, rather than focusing on one aspect of health
- Additionally, all activities are saved under each wellness domain from the home page
- The user can also mark their favorite activities to be saved to a “favorite” list for quick, future reference

**How it was built**

- Michela programmed the application with Swift 4.0 in Xcode and incorporated the Twilio API and Alamofire API
- Devin and Sneha created the app design with Canva, Photoshop, and Powerpoint

**Challenges we ran into**

- In the beginning, we tried to think of a flashy idea that would solve many different problems. However, given our time crunch, we decided it would cleaner to create a more focused app. 
- It was also challenging to work with a new API that none of us had used before.  

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**

- We are proud that we have been able to incorporate two APIs. 
- Delivering a rather complete, good looking prototype!

**What’s next for Eudemonia**

- In the future, we hope to add the functionality for users to be able to share their own wellness activities and be able to add it to our database of activities. Additionally, we want to add the ability for users to mark tasks off as they complete them and establish some sort of reward system to encourage users to continue to use the app.
